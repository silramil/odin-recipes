        <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
        <img src="../recipes-images/chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg" alt="Chocolate chip cookies">
        <p>This is a chocolate chip recipe I pulled from <a href=https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies>Betty Crocker's website.</a></p>
        <p>It's supposed to be the ultimate recipe for gooey chocolate chip cookies.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2.25 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>0.75 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>0.75 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.</li>
        <li>Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.</li>
